# React Test Starter
This is an exercise, [adapted from this article](https://coderfiles.dev/blog/reactjs-coding-exercises/), which we are
using at prima as a base for frontend candidates to work and expand on duing their pairing interview.

## App features
- The app fetches 10 random `Users` from an [api endpoint](https://random-data-api.com/api/users/random_user) and displays 
their basic information on cards.
- Each card can be clicked, triggering a flip animation which displays some more information on the back.

## Technologies/Requirements
- yarn >= 1.22 
- node >= 14.17 
- This app is bootstrapped from `create-react-app`. We expect frontend candidates to be comfortable and familiar with React.
- This app uses `styled-components` for styling. However, candidates may use plain CSS during the interview if they wish.

## Running
To install dependancies run: 

```
yarn
```

To start the development server, run:

```
yarn start
```
